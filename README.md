  ## Practice 1 
This practice creates algorithms and also variables can be played with, aside from defining the diference between value and variable in scala 

> 1.- Develope a scala algorithm that calcules the radius of a circle
```
import scala.math.sqrt
val r: Double= sqrt(A/3.1416)
```
This formula ( r=√ Area/π ) is used to retrieve the radius with the area. The sqrt function is used to retrieve the root. Scala does not have library predefined therefore we must first import with scala.math.sqrt

> 2.- Develop a scala algorithm tells me if a number is prime
```
if (Num%2==0){
    println("It's not a number prime ")
    }else{
        println("It's prime")
        }
```
Variable Num can be created with any desired number, a prime number is divisible only by itself and 1, with the algorithm in place if the residue of its division is 0, it prints out as a non prime, in contrary case it will inform number is prime.

> 3.- Given the variable bird = "tweet", use interpolation of string to print "I'm writing a tweet"
```
val bird = "tweet"
val tweet = s"I'm writing a $bird"
```
Variable tweet is a chain of text to which variable bird is added

> 4.- Given the variable message = "Hello Luke, I am your father!" use slilce to extract the sequence "Luke"
```
val message = "Hello Luke, I am your father!"
message slice  (6,10)
```
Message slice takes the characters its indicated, starting from character 6 it begins taking information up until character 10.

> 5.- What's the difference between value and variable in scala?
```
"var" it's a variable mutable in the program this data can be change but
in "val" this data can't change because is immutable 
```

> 6.- Given the tuple (2,4,5,1,2,3,3.1416,23) returns 3.1416
``` 
val MyTuple = (2,4,5,1,2,3,3.1416,23)
MyTuple._7
```
When MyTuple._7 is defined the number 7 element is selected from that tuple

  ## Practice 2 
In this pratice we make use of lists, arrays and maps
> 1.- Create a list called "list" with the elements "red", "white", "black"
```
val list = List("red","white","black")
```
A variable is created in list mode which will contain elements requested
>2.- Add 5 more items to "list" "green", "yellow", "blue", "orange", "pearl"
```
val list= collection.mutable.Set("red","white","black")
```
in order to add values into list, it first needs to be mutable
```
list+="green"
list+= "yellow"
list+="blue"
list+= "orange"
list+="pearl"
```
Once the list is mutable the elements requested can be added

>3.- Bring the items from "list" "green", "yellow", "blue"
```
for (lists <- list) { 
    if(lists =="green" || lists =="yellow" || lists=="blue")
    println(lists)
    }
```
In order to print the required values a cycle (for) was created which will run through the entire list searching for elements that meet the condition of if, the similitude is print after it is found

>4.-  Create an Array of numbers in the range 1-1000 in steps of 5 by 5
```
val arrNum=Array.range(1,1000,5)
```
A variable is created in Array mode, followed by the range function along side in which the initiating number is given seperated by coma then the finalizing number is added to finish off with the steps.

> 5.- What are the unique elements of the list list(1,3,3,4,6,7,3,7)  use conversion to sets
```
val list = List(1,3,3,4,6,7,3,7)
list.toSet
```
toSet converts the List to a Set, show the elements without repeating: Set(1, 6, 7, 3, 4)

> 6.- Create a map mutable named Names containing the following elements: "Jose", 20, "Luis", 24, "Ana", 23, "Susana", "27"
```
val Names = collection.mutable.Map(("Jose", 20), ("Luis", 24), ("Ana", 23), ("Susana", 27))
Names
```
The first parameter is the key and the second is its value

> 6(a).- Print all of the keys of the map
```
Names.keys
```
only the maps keys will be printed: Set(Susana, Ana, Luis, Jose)

> 6(b).- Add the following value to the map("Miguel", 23)
```
Names += ("Miguel" -> 23)
```
when writting the maps name with += it allows the addage of a new key with value to a map already created: Map(Susana -> 27, Ana -> 23, Miguel -> 23, Luis -> 24, Jose -> 20)

  ## Practice 3
  In practice 3 we analyse the code of 4 functions and we explained with our own word, also we made the pseudocode (This one es in the practice)

>First code
```
  def listEvens(list:List[Int]): String ={
    for(n <- list){
        if(n%2==0){
            println(s"$n is even")
        }else{
            println(s"$n is odd")
        }
    }
    return "Done"
}
```

The first function tells us if in a list the number is even or odd:

The function is declared with def where the parameter to be received is a list and the result is a string.
A for loop is made to print all the results to the elements of the list, where n is each element in the list and list indicates where to stop (Number of elements).
if is declared, n%2==0 indicates that the remainder of the division of n over 2 must be 0, if so, it will print that is even, otherwise it will print that it is odd.
Once the for loop ends it will print a string that says "Done" to indicate that the function has finished.


>Second Code
```
def afortunado(list:List[Int]): Int={
    var res=0
    for(n <- list){
        if(n==7){
            res = res + 14
        }else{
            res = res + n
        }
    }
    return res
}
```
The number 7 is considered of fortune, this second function makes a sum between the numbers of a list, but 7 is worth double:

The function is declared with def where the parameter to be received is a list and the result is an Int. The variable res is declared as 0 which is the one that is going to increase. A for loop is made to accumulate the sum, where n is each element in the list and list indicates where to stop (Number of elements). An if is declared indicating that if the number is 7, Add 14 to the result, otherwise the result is added the number of the list and at the end of the for loop return the result of the summation.

>Third code
```
def balance(list:List[Int]): Boolean={
    var primera = 0
    var segunda = 0

    segunda = list.sum

    for(i <- Range(0,list.length)){
        primera = primera + list(i)
        segunda = segunda - list(i)
        if(primera == segunda){
            return true
        }
    }
    return false 
}

val bl = List(3,2,1)
val bl2 = List(2,3,3,2)
val bl3 = List(10,30,90)

balance(bl) //TRUE output 3 = 3
balance(bl2) ///TRUE output 5 = 5
balance(bl3) //FALSE output 0 /= 130
```
A function is created which will receive as data a list, this will return a data in Boolean mode
Two variables named *primera” and “segunda” are created and initiated in 0
Variable "segunda" is assigned the value of the sum of all elements from the list it receives
Creating a cycle that will run through the entire list from 0 to the end of list
Each cycle pass will be assigned to "primera" containing the value result from "primera" that is in each cycle
The list value is added in position i ( position of the cycles pass ) 
variable "segunda" is assigned the value of "segunda" which at primera was the total sum and to this
the lists' element value is subtracted at each cycles' position
in "if", variables "primera" and "segunda" are compared for similar value at each pass to return true 
in case the "for" ends and finds no similarity it returns "false”
three lists are created with different value and are valued in function

>Fourth code
```
def palindromo(palabra:String):Boolean ={
    return (palabra == palabra.reverse)
}

val palabra = "OSO" 
val palabra2 = "ANNA"
val palabra3 = "JUAN"

println(palindromo(palabra)) //TRUE output "OSO"
println(palindromo(palabra2)) //TRUE output "ANNA"
println(palindromo(palabra3)) //FALSE output "NAUJ"
```

A function is created which will receive a variable in String mode and will return a Boolean data types "TRUE or FALSE" will be returned when comparing the variable input that is the same as the variable input with the "reverse" function, this function will write the variables data in reverse

  ## Practice 4
 In this practice we code five pseudocode of fibonacci sequence from [Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucesión_de_Fibonacci)

 > Recursive version
 ```
 def fib(N: Int): Int = {
    if (N <2){
        return N
    }
    else {
       return fib(N-1) + fib (N-2)
    }
}
```
The first code is the recursive version, the parameter to be received is the number we want to calculate and the result is Int.

If N is 0 or 1, it will return N, otherwise, it will do a sum of the function were we rest 1 at the first one, and the second one we rest 2.

An example is that if we give N the value of 2, 2 is not < than 2, so it will go to the else code, it will sum fib (2-1) + fib (2-2) and the result is fib (1) + fib (0), we know that when N is 1 or 0, it will return N, the result is 1 + 0 = 1, the result of fib(2) is 1.

Now let's see that with 3, in the else code it will sum fib(3-2) + fib(3-1), and the result is fib(2) + fib(1), since 2 is not < than 2, it will do the function again, we already know that from the previous example the answer of fib(2) is 1, the result is 1 + 1 = 2.

> Version with explicit formula
```
import scala.math.sqrt
import scala.math.BigDecimal

def fib2(N: Int): Double = {
if (N <2){
        return N
    }
    else {
        var i = (1+ sqrt(5))/2
        var j = (scala.math.pow(i,N) - scala.math.pow((1-i),N))/sqrt(5)
        
        return BigDecimal(j).setScale(2, BigDecimal.RoundingMode.HALF_UP).toDouble
    }
}
```
This one is more complicated, the result of the function is Double because the libraries to raise a number to the N potency throw the results in double.
if is the same, but else have 2 variables, i and j.

The result of i will be the same regardless of the number we give to N, is the sum of 1 and 
The square root of 5, where sqrt is the library we need (We have to import the library first), and the result is divided by 2

In j we use scala.math.pow(,), this is to raise a number to the N potency, the first parameter is the number to raise and second one is the potency.

BigDecimal() is to reduce decimals, some results came out with many decimals, so we return j with this conversion.


The difference with this function and the first one is that you will not be entering the function again and again until N is 0 or 1, it will give the precise result the first time.

> Iterative version
```
def fib3(N: Int): Int = {
var a = 0
var b = 1
var c = 0

var i = 0
while (i < N) {
    c = b + a
    a = b 
    b = c

    i = i +1
}
return a
}
```
The result of the function is int, we declare variables a, b and c, this are to accumulate the sum of the fibonacci sequence, and we declared i like a counter in the while cycle, it will sum the variables until i is not < than N, and return a.

The difference with this function and the first and second one is that you will not be entering the function again and again and it does not give you the precise result the first time, but you know how many times it will go through the while cycle, not like the first function that you don't know how many times it will enter the function again
