# Pearson Correlation
## Introduction
This research describes the Pearson correlation coefficient in which situations its characteristics are used as well as a simple and practical example to be able to understand the subject a little better.
It is important to know in which situations we can use this coefficient, such as in the statistical relationship between two preferably linear continuous variables, for this type of implicit relationship to exist.
## Developing
Pearson's correlation coefficient is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two continuous variables. If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not adequately represented.

The correlation coefficient can take a range of values ​​from +1 to -1. A value of 0 indicates that there is no association between the two variables. A value greater than 0 indicates a positive association. That is, as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other. A value less than 0 indicates a negative association; that is, as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other decreases.

To carry out the Pearson correlation it is necessary to fulfill the following:

- The measurement scale must be an interval or ratio scale.
- The variables must be approximately distributed.
- The association must be linear.
- There should be no outliers in the data.

The correlation between two variables reflects the degree to which the scores are associated. The classic formulation, known as Pearson's product moment correlation, is symbolized by the Greek letter rho (xy) when it has been calculated in the population. If it is obtained on a sample, it is designated by the letter "rxy".
This type of statistic can be used to measure the degree of relationship of two variables if both use a measurement scale at the interval / ratio level (quantitative variables).
The formula is usually expressed as:

The first expression is solved using the covariance and standard deviations of the two variables (in their unbiased form).
La segunda forma se utiliza cuando partimos de las puntuaciones típicas empíricas.
## Characteristics
- It takes values between [-1, 1], with 1 being a perfect positive linear correlation and -1 a perfect negative linear correlation.
- It is an independent measure of the scales in which the variables are measured.
- It does not vary if transformations are applied to the variables.
- It does not take into account that the variables are dependent or independent.
- Pearson's correlation coefficient is not equal to the slope of the regression line.
- It is sensitive to outliers, so it is recommended, if they can be justified, to exclude them from the analysis.
## Example

Observa que los datos tipificados (expresados como puntuaciones z) en las dos columnas de la derecha tienen los mismos valores en ambas variables, since the relative positions are the same in variables X and Y.

If we obtain the products of the typified values for each case, the result is

The quotient of dividing the sum of products (5) by N (it must be taken into account that N is the number of cases, NOT the number of data) is equal to 1:

## Conclution
This coefficient is used to analyze the correlation between two variables within statistical analysis, these must be linear or maintain a continuous final relationship to be used.
A simple example would be space time with an object moving at a constant speed, this would be a perfectly positive linear correlation since they both increase at the same time in a correlational way.
